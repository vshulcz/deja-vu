// The plugin's decision, kept out of index.js because a host is free to treat
// anything a plugin module exports as part of the plugin — opencode does
// exactly that with its own — and this is a helper, not a second plugin.

// contributions says what this package adds, given what `deja install` already
// wrote into DSH_HOME and what the profile turned off. The rule is the same
// everywhere: fill the gaps, never repeat the installer.
//
// command.js and the mcp-deja profile row are written by the same install, so
// the command file standing there means the model can already reach deja —
// registering these tools would list every answer twice. auto.js is separate:
// only `deja install dsh-auto` writes it, so a profile can take the command
// from the installer and still want recall from here.
